                <p class="body2"><strong>Kamanue </strong>(釜鵺 <em>Kamanue</em>) was a member of the Twelve Kizuki, having held the new position of Lower Rank Six.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Appearance</h1>
              
                <p class="body2">Kamanue was a short young man with incredibly pale skin, his face decorated by a thick line of dark green under both of his eyes and across his nose that ran up vertically into another, shorter horizontal line on his forehead. Four large dots were also placed at the far ends of the line on his cheeks, the middle of the one on his forehead, and below his lower lip.<br><br>His eyes were cat-like in shape, the pupils slit and the irises pale blue with a white ring around the sides, the kanjis for "Lower Six" etched onto them. Kamanue also possessed dark brown hair with bright orange tips that was worn swept back but fluffed out on either side of his head and neck. He wore a white haori with a yellow scale pattern down the sleeves, as well as a white button-up shirt and dark hakama pants.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Personality</h1>

                <p class="body2">Kamanue was a very on-edge individual who constantly wore a scared expression, which is likely to do with the fact that he felt weak and yielding as the lowest of the Lower Ranks. He appeared to be constantly skittish during his short time at the Infinity Castle, suggesting a nervous personality.</p>

                </figure>

                <p class="body2">After the death of Rui, Lower Rank Five, Kamanue was summoned to the Infinity Castle by Nakime. He was surprised to find himself in the immense fortress, visibly nervous as to why he is here. He quickly noticed Wakuraba and Mukago in the distance, before turning around and finding Enmu and Rokuro in the castle with him, and he realized a gathering of the Lower Ranks had never happened ever. Before he could question the situation further, Nakime transported the demons in front of her and another female demon. <br><br> He wondered who the woman in front of them is, only to be answered with a familiar threatening voice. Kamanue and the Lower Ranks quickly bowed down when they realized the demon before them was Muzan Kibutsuji himself, who had disguised himself to lower their alertness to the situation. When Mukago attempted to apologize on their behalf, Muzan silenced her and went on to explain the death of Rui, before he demanded to know why they, Lower Ranks, are so weak. <br><br>Muzan lectured them about how being in the ranks of the Twelve Kizuki isn't the end; it was only the beginning of what is to come. He stated their sole purpose is to consume blood so they can be of use to him. He continued explaining that it had been over a century and the Upper Ranks have remained unchanged, and it had always been them who have disposed of the Hashira, yet the Lower Ranks were replaced frequently if not constantly. When he heard this, Kamanue scoffed at how it seems easy for Muzan to talk about, only for Muzan to repeat the phrase aloud. </p>

                <p class="body2">Capable of reading the minds of his demons, Muzan asked Kamanue why he couldn't be told that. When he realized he is in trouble, he heard as Muzan angrily demanded him to continue his words, before expanding and extending his arm into a tentacle to grab the Lower Rank by his body. Kamanue tearfully attempted to apologize, but was promptly devoured by Muzan as the rest of the Lower Ranks, except Enmu, keep their heads lowered in shocked silence. </p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><u><span class="bold">Demon Abilities</span></u></strong> <br><span</p>

                <p class="body2">Little was known about Kamanue's strength and abilities as a Demon, but it can be assumed that he was stronger than Kyogai, the former member of the Twelve Kizuki whose place he took.</p>
