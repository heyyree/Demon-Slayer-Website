                <p class="body2"><strong>Horned Demon </strong>(角状鬼 <em>Tsunojō Oni</em>) was a demon that lived in the Tsuzumi Mansion.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Appearance</h1>
              
                <p class="body2">The Horned Demon has shoulder length black hair, with a center split and a single horn in the middle of his forehead. He has distinct red eyes with vertical pupils, slanted in an upward position, as well as thick protruding lips.<br><br>The Horned Demon had a large physical build, with visible veins displayed on the majority of his body. He wore green hakama pants with a brown vest. </p>

                <h1 class="header3">Personality</h1>

                <p class="body2">The Horned Demon was prideful and confident, as seen when he showed no hesitation to attack at the sight of Inosuke Hashibira, even boasting about the fact that he'd soon taste Inosuke's flesh and sarcastically complimenting his attack. However, his pride and lack of caution quickly became his downfall as he underestimated Inosuke, showing a lack of ability to properly size up his opponent before fighting them.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">History</h1>

                <p class="body2">Inside the Tsuzumi Mansion, he and the Tongue Demon got into a scuffle with Kyogai over who would get to eat Kiyoshi, a boy Kyogai had found and wanted to devour for his Marechi blood. During the confrontation, the Horned Demon managed to rip off one of Kyogai's tsuzumi, which Kiyoshi quickly grabbed and used to transport himself to safety. The three demons then wandered the mansion in search of Kiyoshi.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Synopsis</h1>

                <p class="body2">While running through the halls of the mansion, Inosuke was nearly grabbed by the Horned Demon as he was turning at a corner. The demon deemed him a "fresh human" and tried again to grab his prey. However, Inosuke slashed off both of the demon's arm and used his Beast Breathing, Third Fang: Devour to slice off the Horned Demon's head, before using the body to launch himself for another search around the mansion.</p>


                <h1 class="header3">Abilities</h1>

                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Enhanced Strength: </span></strong> The Horned Demon was able to rip out one of Kyogai's tsuzumi from his back, which would have taken a large amount of strength. He is also shown to easily crush hard wood simply by grabbing it, seen when he tried to grab Inosuke.</p>
