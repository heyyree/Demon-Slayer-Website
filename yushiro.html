                <h1 class="header2"> <em> "Someone who never gives to others will someday become unable to receive anything from them. Only wanting is, in the end, the same as having nothing... because one is unable to create anything. Such a pity to die alone."</em><br><strong>-Yushiro</strong><em><span class=letter> to Kaigaku in Pride</span></em> </h1>

                <p class="body2"><strong>Yushiro </strong>(愈史郎<em>Yushirō</em>) is a major supporting character of <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em>. He is the traveling companion of Tamayo and a close ally of Tanjiro Kamado. Yushiro was turned into a demon by Tamayo when he had a terminal illness. <br><br> During the Infinity Castle Arc and Sunrise Countdown Arc, Yushiro, along with Tamayo, joins forces with the Demon Slayer Corps to aid in the war against Muzan Kibutsuji. </p>

                <h1 class="header3">Appearance</h1>
              
                <p class="body2">Yushiro has the appearance of a young boy of short stature and average build with pale skin and lavender purple eyes. He has short hair that is neatly styled and vertically shaded from a dull and light green to black.<br><br> Yushiro wears a button-up collared shirt under an all-white iromuji-haori and dark blue Seigo-Sendeihira styled hakama pants.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Personality</h1>

                <p class="body2">From his first appearance, it is evident he has a short temper and holds an arrogant attitude, looking down on most around him. He was called immature from the author. His first conversation with Tanjiro even begins with him insulting Nezuko Kamado for being an eyesore. He is usually depicted with a scowl on his face and rarely seen smiling unless when speaking about and or admiring Tamayo, who he is in love with. <br><br>He only cares for Tamayo and hates when others get in the way of his spending time with her and dislikes not being by her side for even a minute. In fact, he cares so little for others (and only for Tamayo) that while Tanjiro and Nezuko were fighting two demons who were trying to kill them, Yushiro suggested to Tamayo that they use Tanjiro and Nezuko as decoys to run from the demon, a suggestion that horrified Tamayo. Though Yushiro claimed he was joking to appease her, it is evident he genuinely considered it. <br><br> He hates when others get too close to Tamayo, expressing even the smallest bit of attraction, or he perceives that someone insults her. He himself tends to fawn over her a great deal. He seems to be insulted when Tanjiro suggests that all demons have a hard time controlling their desire to feast on humans, asking Tanjiro if he thought all demons were that bloodthirsty. Despite this, he can show respect towards others, as he did take back his comment about Nezuko being an eyesore and called her pretty at the end of the episode and also covered Tanjiro's mouth to prevent him from inhaling Tamayo's perfume, which is harmful to humans. </p>

                </figure>

                <p class="body2">Yushiro was a human who was under the care of Tamayo as she was practicing as a medical practitioner. He was in frail state fighting a disease when Tamayo gave him the choice of succumbing to his illness or to live longer as a Demon. He agreed to become a Demon and has since stayed by Tamayo's side serving as an assistant as well as her guard. </p>

                <p class="body2">Yushiro and Tamayo first appear to Tanjiro after he encounters Muzan for the first time, though he looks noticeably irritated. Yushiro is later seen waiting for Tanjiro outside a food stall. He then proceeds to insult Nezuko, to which Tanjiro gets upset. Yushiro ignores him and proceeds to lead him to Tamayo's clinic, where she is treating the woman who was injured. When Tanjiro asks Tamayo whether treating humans is uncomfortable, Yushiro hits him and tells him off for it, but Tamayo chastises him gently. He then sits quietly until Tanjiro, who is surprised that Tamayo had turned Yushiro into a demon, asks for Tamayo's age, to which he reacts and punches Tanjiro again. She reprimands him again, more severely this time, and he then sits quietly. </p>

                <p class="body2">He is the first to notice the Susamaru and Yahaba when they attack the house and protectively covers Tamayo when Susamaru's handball breaks through the roof. However, his head gets taken off right after he realizes that the demons are Muzan's underlings. While Tanjiro fights the two demons, Tamayo holds his body as Yushiro regrows his head. Yushiro begins yelling about how the more people are hidden under his Blood Demon Art, the harder it is to hide. He also yells about how he hates it when his time with Tamayo is interrupted. <br><br>Yushiro and Tamayo get hit by the ball several times before he tells Tanjiro to avoid the arrow patterns. He sends a paper talisman to Tanjiro and shares his sight via said paper talisman. </p>

                <p class="body2">Following the final battle against Muzan, Yushiro would later become the last known survivor of the Demon race. In time, he would dedicate himself to a life of art and become a world-famous painter in the present day under the name of Yushiro Yamamoto, known for his paintings of Tamayo to wide critical acclaim. He is known as a mysterious figure with an infamy for his aggression to reporters seeking to interview him. <br><br> He has drawn at least 812 artworks of Tamayo with the 812th work, Tamayo with Dark Blue Flowers, being by Yoshiteru Agatsuma's account his first love. </p>

                <p class="body2">Yushiro is in love with Tamayo and is willing to do anything to protect her. He finds Tamayo very beautiful. He is very obsessed with her and will attack and insult anyone who comes near her but him. Upon sensing Tamayo's death at the hands of Muzan, Yushiro becomes enraged, evidenced by his suddenly elongated fangs. <br><br>In the modern era, it is evident that Yushiro is still alive but takes an occupation as a painter painting pictures of Tamayo since he still has great respect and loyalty to her after all these years. <br><br>When a crow came to visit Tamayo, he felt that she was disturbed. Yushiro was cleaning and fell down the stairs. </p>

                <p class="body2">At first, Nezuko is threatened by Yushiro's presence as she senses that he is a Demon; however after she realizes he shows no ill intent or harm towards her or Tanjiro, she no longer perceives him as a threat and stops being wary around him.<br><br>Yushiro initially sees her as "unsightly," due to his personal belief that all Demons are disgusting and grotesque with the sole exception being Tamayo, his master and the object of his undying love. However, after they fight side-by-side during the attack on their hidden clinic by Yahaba and Susamaru, he revises his opinion of her, calling her beautiful. Nezuko likewise sees Yushiro as one of her younger siblings and begins patting his head, much to his dismay.</p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><u><span class="bold">Tanjiro Kamado</span></u></strong> <br><span</p>

                <p class="body2">At first glance, the two don't get along well, as Tanjiro had asked how old she was, and they fight. But later on in the story, they grow respect for each other, going so far to tell Tanjiro how much he admired Tamayo.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Abilities</h1>

                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Overall Abilities:</span></strong> Yushiro is a demon of unknown strength, although living for a long time under Tamayo, who is herself a deceptively strong demon who could severely weaken Muzan, it is assumed that Yushiro is a competent fighter as well who can make use of Blood Demon Arts. Yushiro for his part, however, is more of a support combatant aiding others with his powers to allow them to discern invisible things or otherwise mask his allies' presence. Most impressively, Yushiro is strong enough to wrestle for command against Muzan over a demon, albeit with the help of the Demon Slayers to interrupt Muzan's concentration.</p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Body Modification:</span></strong> Through unknown surgical procedures, Yushiro's body has been adapted to live with minimal human blood consumption and no drive to hunt humans. Tamayo stated that Yushiro requires less blood than she does to sustain himself.</p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Curse Immunity:</span></strong> As a result of being a demon created by Tamayo who severed her link with Muzan, Yushiro is by default not linked to him and as such immune from Muzan's control, preventing the Demon King from exerting any influence over him, such as destroying him remotely or reading his thoughts albeit Muzan was able to partially spread his cells to Yushiro's hand to wrestle Nakime's control from him and to kill him.</p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Medical Skills:</span></strong>  Being Tamayo's aide, Yushiro is also an expert medic being familiar of her special techniques and drugs. After rescuing Zenitsu from falling to his death, he was able to make use of numerous medicine in order to prevent the damage inflicted by Kaigaku's Blood Demon Art to spread further. He was also able to resuscitate a nearly dead Tanjiro to health, allowing the latter to be able to fight again.</p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Talented Painter: </span></strong> Within the Reiwa Era of Japan, Yushiro became an artist who paints photorealistic pictures of Tamayo on a canvas which have received critical acclaim from all around the world. His paintings are so realistic that some people mistake them for photos.</p>

                    <figcaption>Yushiro's Blindfold.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Blindfold: </span></strong> Yushiro's Blood Demon Art allows him to create paper talismans which possess the ability to mask or reveal something's presence. By placing these on certain objects of his choosing, he can get rid of their presence. Otherwise, by placing it on someone's forehead, he can enhance their vision by revealing the presence of masked objects. <br><br> Yushiro has used this Blood Demon Art to completely hide the entrance to Tamayo's clinic in Asakusa, and used it to create illusory walls to make it less suspicious as well. However, he couldn't mask its existence completely from Yahaba's own Blood Demon Art's tracking ability. He can also render himself invisible using his Blindfold. Yushiro has also used this to reveal Yahaba's hidden arrows and bestow this power to Tanjiro as well. During the Infinity Castle Arc, it seems Yushiro's Blood Demon Art has developed considerably. Not only can he create dozens of his paper talismans at once, but he can use them to completely mask their presence but still see one another, granting them a slight advantage against Muzan. His Blood Demon Art can allow two beings to use their vision in tandem to increase their efficiency in combat, as seen with Obanai Iguro and his pet snake Kaburamaru. <br><br>Yushiro's paper talismans were also able to link Kiriya and his sisters to the location of the Demon Slayers in real time through the Kasugai Crows that were also wearing the paper talismans on their neck. This allows them to not only see through the paper talismans on the Kasugai Crows, but also issue commands to them. They have used this connection to gain information of battle results, casualties, and the Infinity Castle's constantly changing structure. </p>

                    <p class="body2"><li class="indent-list"><strong><span class="bold">Mind Control:</span></strong> During the Infinity Castle Arc, Yushiro displays a new ability of his Blood Demon Art, which allows him to put an individual with his Blindfold under hypnosis and take control of their minds and vision. If used on a demon, he is able to make use of their techniques through them as shown when he used Nakime's Blood Demon Art to bring the Demon Slayers to the surface while the Infinity Castle was collapsing. His control over them is not only mental but also physical, as evidenced by his brief contest with Muzan over Nakime, where both parties controlled her body as they wrestled for command. Yushiro impressively was able to fight Muzan absorbing his cells through Nakime, thus implying Yushiro manipulates his victims on a cellular level. One drawback to this ability is that Yushiro is required to be in proximity of his target to control them.</li></p>
