                <p class="body2"><strong>Tongue Demon </strong>(舌鬼 <em>Shita oni</em>) was a demon that lived in the Tsuzumi Mansion.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Appearance</h1>
              
                <p class="body2">The Tongue Demon was a muscular man with gray skin and very dark blue hair, set noticeably far back on his head to make room for the two small horns that protruded from either side of his forehead. He had two pairs of eyes, one large and cat-like of a green color and the other more squinted and set above the first, their irises red. His most notable features were his extremely long tongue and the navy blue arrows that patterned his nose and forearms, a large blotch of a similar color on each temple. <br><br>The Tongue Demon wore nothing above his waist, under which he sported only the bottom half of a patterned knee-length yukata. </p>

                <h1 class="header3">Personality</h1>

                <p class="body2">The Tongue Demon, as with many others of his kind, was a ruthless being who seemed only to care about eating any and all humans that crossed his path. He appeared to be somewhat unintelligent, as he often talked to himself and repeated words when speaking as well as slithered around on the floor rather than walking. </p>

                <h1 class="header3">History</h1>

                <p class="body2">Before Tanjiro Kamado and Zenitsu Agatsuma entered the mansion, the Tongue Demon discovered the manor's demon Kyogai had found a boy, Kiyoshi, which he had intended to devour for his Marechi blood. They were joined by a third demon and the three fought over who had the right to devour the boy. In the argument, the Horned Demon ripped off a tsuzumi from Kyogai's back, which Kiyoshi grabbed and used to transport himself away from them, leaving the three demons to look for him inside the mansion.</p>

                </figure>

                <p class="body2">While crawling around the Tsuzumi mansion, the Tongue Demon happened upon Zenitsu, a member of the Demon Slayer Corps, and Shoichi, the younger brother of his desired prey Kiyoshi. He startled the two with his unusual appearance and long tongue, before chasing them into an empty room. Overwhelmed by the creature's grotesque appearance and his fear of demons, Zenitsu suddenly lost consciousness, to the Tongue Demon's confusion.</p>

                </figure>

                <p class="body2">He attempts to grab Shoichi with his tongue but unexpectedly has the tip of it sliced off, which the demon fails to see. Zenitsu suddenly arose and began to breathe, which confuses and scares the Tongue Demon, who notes that his aura has changed. In an instant, the Demon Slayer beheads the demon with his Thunder Breathing, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash. The demon's head rolls next to Zenitsu, who becomes startled by the demon's unexpected death upon snapping awake.</p>
