                <p class="body2"><strong>Murata </strong>(村田<em>Murata</em>) is a supporting character of<em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> and a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Appearance</h1>
              
                <p class="body2">Murata possesses plain and unremarkable features; straight jet-black hair parted down the middle, similarly colored eyes and possesses an athletic build. <br> <br> Murata wears the black standard Demon Slayer uniform, consisting of a gakuran jacket and tattsuke-hakama pants.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Personality</h1>

                <p class="body2">Not much is known about Murata, however, he does not like it when a hunter of lower rank chastises him. He is somewhat timid, however he does seem braver than most, continuing to fight atop Mount Natagumo even after his entire group was wiped out.</p>

                
                <h1 class="header3">History</h1>

                <p class="body2">Before becoming a Demon Slayer, Murata's family was killed by demons. Because he had no living relatives left, he joined the Demon Slayer Corps. <br> <br>Murata's history before his mission to Mount Natagumo is unknown, however he, much like most of the first Demon Slayers sent to the mountain, was fairly low in rank. <br> <br> Murata was in the same final selection as Sabito and Giyu. Despite that, he claims to have many differences with him. </p>

                
                <h1 class="header3">Synopsis</h1>

                <p class="body2"><strong><u><span class="bold">Mount Natagumo Arc</span></u></strong></p>

                </figure>

                <p class="body2">Having been sent to Mount Natagumo to exterminate the Demons living there, Murata is approached by Tanjiro Kamado and Inosuke Hashibira. He explains to them how the Demon Slayers sent to the area started killing each other as soon as they arrived. He is then startled by the arrival of another group of these puppet soldiers. Locked in combat with one of them, he is saved from a sneak attack by his two juniors, hastily introducing himself while resuming his fight. The senior officer urges them to leave the puppet soldiers to him, despite Inosuke's insults, warning them of the possibility of stronger controlled people up ahead.</p>

                </figure>

                <p class="body2">Murata visits Tanjiro, Inosuke, and Zenitsu Agatsuma at the Butterfly Mansion. He complains about the hellish situation of being summoned to the Hashira Meeting to report what had happened on Natugumo Mountain, but hastily leaves when Shinobu comes to visit.</p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><u><span class="bold">Hashira Training Arc</span></u></strong></p>

                <p class="body2">Murata meets Tanjiro and Inosuke during his training with Gyomei Himejima. He points out how harsh training is, and is impressed by how strong the Hashira are. It is unknown if he passed Himejima's training or gave up.</p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><u><span class="bold">Infinity Castle Arc</span></u></strong></p>

                <p class="body2">Murata rescues Zenitsu and Yushiro during the battles in the Infinity Castle. Later on, after the fortress collapses, Giyu Tomioka asks him to bring a fallen Tanjiro to safety and treat his wounds.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Abilities</h1>

                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Overall Abilities:</span></strong> Although not on par with the likes of Tanjiro or Inosuke, Murata's prowess is superior to that of his squad, as evidenced by being its only survivor (albeit with the aid of multiple characters). His assistance in dealing with his manipulated comrades was vital in buying time for Tanjiro and Inosuke to defeat the Mother Spider Demon. Since the puppets had their powers augmented because of the demon's Blood Demon Art, his ability to hold them back was a testament of his above average performance. He was also able to reach the last stage in the Hashira training curriculum, which hardly any members could do.</p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><u><span class="bold">Breathing Style</span></u></strong></p>

                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Water Breathing:</span></strong> (水の呼吸<em>) Mizu no kokyū</em>):Murata is a user of the Water Breathing, however, for Murata, the water is too faint to be able to be seen.</p>

                <p class="body2"><li class="indent-list"><strong><span class="bold">First Form: Water Surface Slash </span></strong>- The user generates enough momentum to create a powerful single concentrated slash.
                </li></p>


                <p class="body2"><li class="indent-list"><strong><span class="bold">Second Form: Water Wheel </span></strong>- The user leaps and vertically spins forward in the air while releasing a flowing attack in a circular motion.
