                <h1 class="header2"><em>"I know what eternity is. Eternity is human feeling. Only human feelings last forever and are undying."</em><br> <strong>-Kagaya Ubuyashiki</strong><em><span class="letter"> to Muzan Kibutsuji</span></em></h1>
                
                <p class="body2"><strong>Kagaya Ubuyashiki </strong>(産屋敷 耀哉 <em>Ubuyashiki Kagaya</em>) is a major supporting character of <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em>. He is the 97th leader of the Demon Slayer Corps known mainly as <strong>Oyakata-sama</strong> (お館様 lit. "Master") by his subordinates and peers and is also the head of the Ubuyashiki Family.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Appearance</h1>
              
                <p class="body2">Kagaya has light skin and black shoulder length hair. He has a curse mark that is slowly killing him that also makes his skin look as if it was rotting, spreading down his face and covering his eyes, making him unable to see. By the time of his death, this curse had spread all over his body making moving nearly impossible. Muzan at Kagaya's death described him as having the smile of Buddha. <br> <br> He wears a plain black kimono secured with a tan-colored braided obi over a white juban. He also wears a white, calf length haori with a unique design of gradient flames of the colors purple and salmon pink rising from the hem up to the half of the sleeves.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Personality</h1>
                
                <p class="body2">Kagaya has a calm demeanor, showing genuine care about the members of the Demon Slayers, considering them his children. He is also able to handle criticism well and his honest about his weaknessess; one being is inability to become a Demon Slayer despite being their main leader. In order to make up for this, he remembers every single member of the corps and visits the deceased members at their cemetery on a daily basis until he could no longer move due to his illess. <br> <br> While he may seem lenient, he gives due consideration to reason; clear of any biases, shown when he willingly accepted the situation of Tanjiro and Nezuko (via a letter from Sakonji Urokodaki) and even defending their cause when there are others who thought otherwise. His manner of speaking, while generally fluid and gently, is extremely tactful; using words and intonations in a way that the person he talks to would listen. His tactful and charismatic speech is even able to make the likes of the initially passive Muichiro Tokito and the impulsive Sanemi Shinazugawa listen to what he has to say without conveying anything that would rile them up. <br> <br> Towards his own kin, such as his children, Kagaya is rather strict, due to the curse of their family. He had to prepare them early on to replace him in leading the Demon Slayers. Nevertheless, he shows the same gently aura and demeanor towards them.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">History</h1>
                
                <p class="body2">Kagaya became the leader of the Demon Slayer Corps when he was only 4 years old. Kagaya first met Amane when he was 13 years old, which was when she was 17. She was specifically selected by a priest to become Kagaya's wife in order to care for his medical needs, but he only agreed to the marriage on the condition that she cared for him on her own free will.</p>

                <h1 class="header3">Abilities</h1>
                
                <p class="body2"><strong><span class="bold">Foresight:</span></strong> Kagaya {and the rest of the Ubuyashiki family) possess a heightened level of foresight that helps them avoid disastrous situation and amassed them a great amount of wealth and fortune. Due to this instinct, Kagaya accurately made several guesses about multiple things that were eventually proven to be true and accurate without him knowing any prior information, as seen when he accurately predicted that Muzan's only remaining weakness was the sun and that he could not be destroyed by decapitation, that the deaths of Gyutaro and Daki would send waves that would eventually see that the Upper Ranks of the Twelve Kizuki begin losing members for the first time in hundreds of years, and that Muzan will find him and bring about the final war between Demon Slayer Corps and the Twelve Kizuki during his last five days of life. <br> <br> <strong><span class="bold">Soothing Voice:</span></strong> Kagaya possesses the ability to put others at ease just by the tone of his voice and rhythm of his actions, as he displayed with Tanjiro Kamado and even the blood-lusted Hashira. In modern times, this attribute is called 1/F Fluctuation, and is said to be possessed by many charismatic people and have the strength of presence to move mass audiences.</p>
